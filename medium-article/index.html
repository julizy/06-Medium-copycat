      <h2>Outline</h2>
      <p>Created by "Breaking Bad" alums Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, "Better Call Saul" follows Jimmy McGill (aka Saul Goodman) (Bob Odenkirk) as he begins his legal career after a life as a grifter and conman. However, the more the criminal lawyer brushes up against his increasingly volatile clientele, the more he gets pulled into the morally gray area between the two sides of the law.</p>
      <h2>First paragraph</h2>
      <p>Much of the final season centers around Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) and Jimmy's plan to ruin Howard Hamlin's (Patrick Fabian) reputation so that he will have to settle the Sandpiper lawsuit, netting Jimmy a handsome payout in the process. However, their plan goes awryÂ in Season 6, Episode 7 ("Plan and Execution") when Lalo Salamanca (Tony Dalton) enters the fray. Surprisingly, there were quite a few different plans about how to get Howard where he tragically ends up.</p>
